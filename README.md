Student Information System in Python

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the use of classes and objects in Python to store and display student information. It defines a "Student" class with attributes for a student's name, roll number, and marks.

🎯 Objectives

- Understand object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.
- Learn how to define a class and create objects.
- Use a constructor to initialize object attributes.
- Display formatted student information.

💻 Source Code

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll, marks):
        self.name = name
        self.roll = roll
        self.marks = marks


s1 = Student("Rahul", 101, 87.5)

print("Name:", s1.name)
print("Roll:", s1.roll)
print("Marks: {:.1f}".format(s1.marks))

⚙️ How It Works

1. Class Definition: The "Student" class defines the structure of a student object.
2. Constructor: The "__init__()" method initializes the object's attributes.
3. Object Creation: The "s1" object is created with the values ""Rahul"", "101", and "87.5".
4. Attribute Access: The program accesses the student's details using "s1.name", "s1.roll", and "s1.marks".
5. Formatted Output: The "format()" method displays marks to one decimal place.

📤 Output

Name: Rahul
Roll: 101
Marks: 87.5

🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Any Python-compatible editor, such as VS Code, PyCharm, or Google Colab.

No external libraries are required.

▶️ How to Run

1. Copy the code into a file named "student.py".
2. Open a terminal in the directory containing the file.
3. Execute the following command:

python student.py

Alternatively, run the code in a Google Colab notebook.

📚 Concepts Covered

- Classes and objects
- Constructors ("__init__")
- Instance attributes
- The "self" parameter
- String formatting
- Basic output operations

🚀 Future Improvements

- Accept student details as user input.
- Add validation for roll numbers and marks.
- Support multiple student records.
- Calculate grades based on marks.
- Store student information in a file or database.
